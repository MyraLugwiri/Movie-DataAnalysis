More research can be done to understand why they have more movies they have acted in apart from the age factor which could indicate they have stayed in the industry for long. Also more more research can be used to indicate the quality of work they do that could also be a factor to why they have acted in so many movies. This can help a casting director make the decision of which actor to include in a movie"

This can be an indication that the budget of a movie can be among the factors that play a role in the revenue generated from a movie. Hence can help inform key stakeholders to consider the funds they decide to invest in the creation of a movie though should take into consideration that other factors play a role in the revenue generated.

More research can be done to understand why **Robert De Niro has acted in numerous movies and hence help in making the decision of how his presence in a movie would affect the budget and also revenue generated</li>\n",
